# Robot Control Stack

**Robot Control Stack (RCS)** is a unified and multilayered robot control interface over a MuJoCo simulation and real world robot currently implemented for the FR3/Panda, xArm7, UR5e and SO101.

## Installation

We build and test RCS on the latest Debian and on the latest Ubuntu LTS.

1.  **System Dependencies**:
    ```shell
    sudo apt install $(cat debian_deps.txt)
    ```

2.  **Python Environment**:
    ```shell
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    ```

3.  **Install RCS**:
    ```shell
    pip install -ve .
    ```

## Hardware Extensions

RCS supports various hardware extensions (e.g., FR3, xArm7, RealSense). These are located in the `extensions` directory.

To install an extension:

```shell
pip install -ve extensions/rcs_fr3
```
